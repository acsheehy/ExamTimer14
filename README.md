Exam Timer for Public Exams

The Exam Timer is a C# on Windows project for displaying a timer during public exams. It is intended for projection on to a screen that can be seen by students and staff. The timings for multiple exams can be shown, including extra time allowances.

The solution relies on the OpenSource Avalon Controls Library v2.0 by Marlon Grech. You will need this library to compile the project yourself. Requires DotNet 4.5 on Windows. See the Wiki for more details.
